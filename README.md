# Voice-to-Text Desktop Application (Tauri + Deepgram)

A cross-platform desktop application that converts voice input into text using **Tauri** and **Deepgram Speech-to-Text API**.  
This project is a functional prototype inspired by **Wispr Flow**, focusing on the **core voice-to-text workflow** rather than visual polish.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical skills in building AI-powered desktop applications using modern tools.
